As the former [VP of Design at Sprinklr](https://sprinklr.com), Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building and leading global design and engineering teams to deliver large-scale, enterprise-grade experiencesâ€”driven by a passion for usability, innovation, and the future of humanâ€“computer interaction.

Iâ€™ve always sat at the intersection of systems thinking, design craft, and code. I started my career as a passionate [web standards advocate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards), and that foundation still informs how I build today: accessibility-first, performance-minded, and human-centered by default.

Most recently, I founded [UselyAI](https://uselyapp.com), a platform I built to close the gap between usability theory and product execution. It helps teams score, monitor, and improve UX in real-timeâ€”bringing design QA and usability scoring into the development process, not just after it. It's a passion project of mine that keeps my dev skill sharp!

I'm especially passionate about the evolving frontier of **Agentic AI UX**â€”moving beyond click-based UI toward **intent-driven** and **intelligence-centered** interfaces. In this work, Iâ€™ve prototyped and shipped co-pilot experiences that blend agent autonomy, contextual assistance, and generative UI patterns. These systems reimagine interaction by anticipating need, simplifying decision-making, and executing tasks on behalf of the userâ€”with clarity and care. Itâ€™s a new design paradigm, and one that demands ethical, intuitive systems design.

ðŸŽ¸ To combine two passions, music and front-end development, I built a mobile remote jukebox UI for my 1954 AMi F-120â€”pairing [React, Firebase, and CSS3](https://github.com/parrfolio/AMI-F120-Virtual-Remote-React) with Raspberry Pi hardware and Python-based stepper/LED controls. This project is open-source, so other enthusiasts can bring their analog systems into the modern age.
