Hello, my name is âœ¨ Parr âœ¨, 

I work at Sprinlkr leading Product Design. I tend to dabble in code being an old [webstandard-ist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards) connoisseur.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a social network for shared music in [React JS](https://reactjs.org/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)!
