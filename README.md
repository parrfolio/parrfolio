Hello, my name is âœ¨ Parr âœ¨, 

I work at [Sprinklr](https://sprinklr.com), leading Product Design. I tend to dabble in code being an old [webstandard-ist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards) and trying to keep up with the industry. Why not write a full-on social network, I thought. So that's what I'm currently doing in my off-hours.

ðŸŽ¸ Iâ€™m currently working on a social network for shared music â™ªâ™«â™¬ â™ª in [React JS](https://reactjs.org/).
ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently learning [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)!
