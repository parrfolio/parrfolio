Hello, my name is âœ¨ Parr âœ¨, 

I work at [Sprinklr](https://sprinklr.com), leading Product Design. I tend to dabble in code being an old [webstandard-ist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards) and trying to keep up with the front-end best practices. Dabbling in figuring out things out of my reach. "Why not write a full-on social network," I thought. So that's what I'm currently doing in my off-hours.

Side Projects to keep my coding nimble:
ðŸŽ¸ A live show music social network â™ªâ™«â™¬ â™ª in [React JS](https://reactjs.org/).
ðŸŽ“ A remote jukebox UI for my 1954 AMI F 120
